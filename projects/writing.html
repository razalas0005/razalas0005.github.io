<b><h5>Steady</h5></b>

You're never too late
You just need to move forward
We're all running our own race
Only competing with ourselves

So focus on you
And your race
Cause that is yours
And yours only

No matter how slow 
No matter how fast
Just keep on pacing
Consistently and steady

Never be afraid to be late
You'll always be first
Because that is your race
So please enjoy it

You're always doing your best
Even a bad day
Will only last for 24 hours
So keep on moving

<b><h5>The guy who bumped you</h5></b>

For the girl in the mall
Who's eyes are very small
A curly and ebony hair
Dark as charcoal

Bumping in to you
Might be the closest thing I got
Hoping next time
Destiny will help us 

I want to know you
Cause you piqued 
My curious mind
When I heard you say sorry
When we accidentally bump into each other

Your voice is unforgettable
Pretty and unusual
The voice that shouts adventure
Yet pure and very kind

I hope we can meet again
In a similar accident
But this time I want one thing
To tell you Hi and I am...
</pre>

<pre>
<b><h5>The Bookworm</h5></b>

Different Books
Parallel stories
You’re in love
With the character
In a fantasy world

Loving the idea
The what if’s
A once in a life time chance
Of having a beautiful tale

Drowning yourself
In a glimpse of a story
That won’t be yours
And will never be real

Because
You are meant
To live 
And just read it
